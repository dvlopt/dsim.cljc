   Arity convention for `e-XXX` functions
   ======================================
  
   Arities for `e-XXX` functions follow the same convention. Providing both `ranks` and `path` refers explicitely
   to a prioritized location in the event tree. Without `path`, the path of the currently executing flat event is
   retrieved (ie. acts with the given `ranks` relative to the current `path`). Not providing either refers explicitely
   to the current flat event and its working queue.

;;;;;;;;;; MAYBEDO


;; Hack persistent queues so that they can also act as a stack?
;; 
;; The front is implemented as a seq, so prepending is efficient, but the seq is
;; package private. Relying on non-public features is not recommended. On the other
;; hand, it is fairly certain the implementation will stay like this.
;;
;; In CLJS, turns out the seq is readily accessible as nothing is really private.


;; Async + parallelize by ranks?
;;
;; By definition, all events with the same ranking are independent, meaning that they
;; can be parallelized without a doubt if needed. But due to the non-blocking nature of
;; JS, it is hard to find a portable solution without buying completely into core.async,
;; meaning going async all the way...

  "Used for building rank-based event engines.
  
   Unless one is building something creative and/or evil, one should feel satisfied with either
   [[basic-engine]] or [[ptime-engine]]. Someone trully interested will study how [[ptime-engine]] is
   built before attempting to use this function for building a specific engine. Will only be useful
   for modelling a universe where time flows differently (multidimensional? some sort of time travel?)

   Returns map containing:

   ```clojure
   {::period-start (fn [ctx]
                     \"Prepares context for running\")
                     
    ::period-end   (fn [ctx]
                     \"Does some clean-up in the context\")
    ::run          (fn
                     ([ctx]

                      \"Ditto, but uses directly the given events (only useful for some optimizations)\"))}
   ```
   
   An engine, if it detects that events need to be processed, must call ::period-start. It can then call
   ::run one or several times, and when all needed events are processed defining some period, the engine
   must call ::period-end. For instance, [[ptime-engine]] considers a single point in time as a period
   during which events can be further ranked."

 (defn wq-delay
 
   "Moves the rest of the working queue to the computed ranks in the event tree.
 
    For instance, inducing a 500 time units delay between 2 events:
 
    ```clojure
    (queue event-a
           (wq-delay (rank+ 500))
           event-b)
    ```

    Particularly useful for modelling activities (sequences of events dispatched in time, using a [[ptime-engine]]).
    Knowing that several events logically bound together at the same path have to be scheduled at different ptimes, one
    approach would be to schedule all of them in one go, eargerly. However, that could quickly lead to the event tree
    becoming extremely big. More importantly, if an earlier event fails (eg. `event-a`), future ones (eg. `event-b`) are
    already scheduled and will execute.
 
    By using [[wq-delay]], both problems are solved. All events are part of the same queue, which makes sense, and
    delays reschedule the rest of the queue when needed. An event failing means the queue fails, so the activity stops.
 
    An example of an activity, a customer in a bank, assuming some sort of random delays being provided:
 
    ```
    (queue customer-arrives
           (wq-delay ...)
           customer-handled
           (wq-delay ...)
           customer-leaves)
    ``` 
   
    Unless something more sophisticated is needed, `ctx->ranks` will often be the result of [[rank+]] or
    [[ranks+]]. If `ctx->ranks` returns nil, no delay is incurred."

    a sample event at the root (without any path) rather than scheduling manually every single element that

 (defn infinite 
 
   "When using a [[ptime-engine]], a flow represent some continuous phenomenon, unlike an event which is
    modelled as being instantaneous and having virtually no duration.

    A flow is sampled, updated could we say, using a [[sample]] event.
 
    An \"infinite\" flow is either endless or ends at a moment that is not known in advance (eg. when the context
    satifies some condition not knowing when it will occur). It can be ended using [[end-flow]].
 
    Here is a simple example of an infinite flow that increments a value and schedules samples itself. In other
    words, that value will be incremented every 500 time units until it is randomly decided to stop. Then, the rest
    of the queue is resumed (`event-a` and `event-b` after a delay of 150 time units).

    ```
    
    Note that when a flow is created, it saves the rest of the working queue and will resume execution when it is done.
    This designs allows for simply building complex sequences of flows and events, including delays if needed (see
    [[wq-delay]]) and repetitions (see [[capture]]).
   
    When created, a flow is sampled right away for initialization. At each sample, a relative ptime is available
    under `[::e-flat ::ptime]]` (returned by [[ptime]]), starting with 0 at the ptime of creation.

 (defn sampler
 
   "A [[sampler]] event schedules a [[sample]] at future ranks computed by 'ctx->ranks'. It will
    continue to do so until there is nothing flowing anymore for that [[path]] or 'ctx->ranks' returns nil.

    It is commonly used for sampling repeatedly a subtree of flows rather than a specific flow. For
    instance, one could use a sampler for drawing every frame of an animation. Supposing a single ptime
    represents one millisecond and we draw at 60 frames per second:

    ```clojure
    (e-conj ctx
            [0 1000000]
            nil
            (sampler (rank+ (/ 1000
                               60))))
    ```

    Two things are interesting. First, besides scheduling for ptime 0, the sampler is scheduled for a
    secondary rank of 1000000, meaning all futures samples it performs, being rescheduled with that
    same secondary rank, will have a very low priority. Second, we did not provide a path, meaning we want
    sampling to occur for the whole flow tree (ie. all existing flows).

    Sometimes, specific flow samples are ordered using further ranks beyond the ptime. Had we scheduled that
    sampler without that secondary rank, all future samples would run with the highest priority within ptimes,
    sampling the whole tree at once, thus disrupting samples that were already ordered for those ptimes in
    a more specific order.
   
    Ensuring that this sampler executes last garantees ordering of all sample events. Remember that
    samples are deduplicated, meaning that when a sample ordered by the sampler executes, it will execute
    only flows that have not been sampled yet."
 
   ([ctx->ranks]
 
    (? (partial sampler
                ctx->ranks)))
 
 
   ([ctx->ranks ctx]
 
    (if-some [ranks (ctx->ranks ctx)]
      (let [current-path (path ctx)]
        (e-conj ctx
                ranks
                current-path
                (-sampler ctx->ranks
                          current-path)))
      ctx))))


;;;;;;;;;; @[fdat]  Serialization of whole contexts (events and flows included) via the `dvlopt.fdat` library


(def serializable

  "It can be particularly useful being able to serialize a `ctx` in order to save if to a file or sending
   it over the wire (saving the whole state of a game, saving long running simulations, sharing them, etc).
  
   However, how could one serialize all those event functions? The answer to that problem is an external library
   called `dvlopt/fdat`. The following functions of this API are indeed serializable using `dvlopt/fdat`:

   - finite
   - infinite
   - mirror
   - pred-repeat
   - rank+
   - ranks+
   - sample
   - sampled-finite
   - sampler
   - stop
   - wq-capture
   - wq-delay
   - wq-do!
   - wq-exec
   - wq-replay
   - wq-sreplay
